this project is simple app for store data of menu card for my JS project https://github.com/Arsedon/nutrition-suggestions.

**Short information about stack:**

1)IOC container - Spring Boot;
2)Connection between front and back part by REST;
3)Data base is H2. Strat by run application;
4)Creating schema and fill tables by hibernate(for example - orm annotations "@Entity" etc)
5)DB connection by JPA repositories;
